#GeoMesa Blobstore
The `AccumuloBlobStore` is a class designed to store and retrieve files which have 
spatio-temporal data associated with them.  During ingest, a pluggable system of `FileHandler`s 
examines the files (and associated maps of parameters) and creates `SimpleFeature`s which are 
inserted into a GeoMesa feature store.  

File retrieval is a two-step process.  First a query is made to the GeoMesa `FeatureStore`.  The 
returned `SimpleFeature`s will contain a URI field.  That URI points to the desired file stored 
in Accumulo, and can be retrieved by the `AccumuloBlobStore` API or REST interface.

## FileHandler Interface

The FileHandler interface is designed to allow file handling in the Blobstore to be pluggable.
Implementors should implement `org.locationtech.geomesa.blob.core.handlers.FileHandler` or 
extend the abstract implementation `org.locationtech.geomesa.blob.core.handlers.AbstractFileHandler`. 
The class `WKTFileHandler` serves as an example of that latter approach.

`FileHandler` implementations are loaded at runtime by the Java ServiceLoader.  As such, available 
implementations should have their classname registered in `META-INF/services/org.locationtech.geomesa.blob.core.handlers.FileHandler`.

## REST api

The RESTful api for the Blobstore can be easily utilized via cURL.
 
To Register a GeoMesa Blob Store to an alias (in this case myBlobStore): 

```bash
curl -d 'instanceId=myCloud' -d 'zookeepers=zoo1,zoo2,zoo3' -d 'tableName=myBlobStore' -d 'user=user' -d 'password=password' http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geomesa/blobstore/ds/myBlobStore
```

Other Blob Store Commands:   

* DELETE /ds/:alias - Delete a previously registered GeoMesa data store  

* GET /ds/:alias - Display a registered GeoMesa data store  

* GET /ds/ - Display all registered .

To ingest a file:

```bash
curl -X POST -F file=@filename.whatever http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geomesa/blobstore/blob/:alias
```

To GET a file with the original filename preserved via id, run:  

```bash  
curl -JO http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geomesa/blobstore/blob/:alias/some-id/
```  

The Blobstore servlet also has optional GZip support which can be used by adding the `--compressed` cURL parameter.  

```bash  
curl --compressed -JO http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geomesa/blobstore/blob/:alias/some-id
```  

To DELETE a file from the blobstore, you must do so by id:

```bash
curl -X "DELETE" http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geomesa/blobstore/blob/:alias/some-id   
```

## Servlet Configuration Options

File upload constraints for the BlobstoreServlet can be configured with the following system properties:

```bash
org.locationtech.geomesa.blob.api.maxFileSizeMB    (defaults to 50MB)
```   
```bash
org.locationtech.geomesa.blob.api.maxRequestSizeMB (defaults to 100MB)  
```

The expected unit for these properties is in MB, so setting `org.locationtech.geomesa.blob.api.maxFileSizeMB=10` will result in a 10MB maxFileSize.
