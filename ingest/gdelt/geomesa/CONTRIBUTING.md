========================

Project Description
-------------------

GeoMesa is a suite of tools for working with big geo-spatial data in a distributed fashion.
GeoMesa's main focus is a GeoTools DataStore implementation backed by Apache Accumulo, but it also
supports streaming data with Apache Kafka, distributed processing with Apache Spark, tools for
converting and ingesting data, and much more.

Contributing
------------

GeoMesa uses git pull requests for contributions. To create a pull request, follow these steps:

* Contributions to GeoMesa must reference a valid JIRA ticket. Contact the GeoMesa developers list
  about opening a ticket, or to have a ticket assigned to you.
* Fork the GeoMesa project on GitHub - go to https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa and click 'Fork'.
* Create a branch on your forked project that contains your work. See 'Coding Standards', below.
* Use GitHub to open a pull request against the locationtech GeoMesa repository - from your branch on
  GitHub, click 'New Pull Request'.
* Respond to comments on your pull request as they are made.
* When ready, your pull request will be merged by an official GeoMesa contributor.

Coding Standards
----------------

* An initial pull request should consist of a single commit, rebased on top of the current master branch.
  * Additional commits can be added in response to code review comments.
* The commit message must consist of a JIRA ticket number followed by a short description, with additional
  information in bullets below as required.
  * See e.g. https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa/commit/1f345132a717816d5a4951f73b2b73537fce305b
* The commit must be signed-off, which indicates that you are taking responsibility for all code contained
  in the commit. This can be done with the `git commit -s` flag.
* Code must be reasonably formatted. Scala does not conform well to automatic formatting, but in general
  GeoMesa tries to adhere to the official Scala style guide: http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/
* Code must contain an appropriate license header. GeoMesa is licensed under Apache 2.
* Code should include unit tests when appropriate.
