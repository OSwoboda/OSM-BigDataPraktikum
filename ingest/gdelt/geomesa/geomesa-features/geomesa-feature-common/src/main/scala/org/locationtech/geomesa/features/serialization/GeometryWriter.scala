  /**
   * Based on the method from geotools WKBWriter. This method is optimized for kryo and simplified from
   * WKBWriter in the following ways:
   *
   * 1. Doesn't save SRID (geomesa didn't use that functionality in WKBWriter)
   * 2. Doesn't handle dimensions > 2
   * 3. Doesn't worry about byte order (handled by kryo)  TODO does avro handle byte order?
   * 4. Doesn't use a precision model
